## Installation

## Training Data
We use a portion of the Tetrominoes dataset for training, which we borrowed 
from https://github.com/adityabingi/Slot-Attention. As noted in that repository, the Tetrominoes dataset is part 
of the Google Multi-Object Datasets and is available as TFRecords [here](https://github.com/deepmind/multi_object_datasets).
We only use h5py versions of this dataset that @pemami4911 created by modifying the TFRecords. We copied a version 
of this and made it available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RNEdk4UI2pnGr_B3ZWqsBwBRolGRT2VJ/view?usp=sharing).
