# Slot Attention

This repository implements Slot Attention, as described in the paper [Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15055). We use a portion of the Tetrominoes dataset for training, which we borrowed 
from https://github.com/adityabingi/Slot-Attention. As noted in that repository, the Tetrominoes dataset is part 
of the Google Multi-Object Datasets and is available as TFRecords here: https://github.com/deepmind/multi_object_datasets. 
We only use h5py versions of this dataset that @pemami4911 created by modifying the TFRecords. These are available 
[here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/q3hpr8gn0hiuzxqq36zlp/clevr6_with_masks_train.h5?rlkey=sr2flkzn6t3g1cfc4rscd487t&e=1&dl=0) 
for download.
